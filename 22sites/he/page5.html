<h1>About me</h1>
<img src="assets\me.jpg" alt="about" hight="10%" width="10%">

<p>My name is Hossein Esmaeelzadeh and I'm a student doing IT course at cheadle college in Stockport, Uk. I'm trying to learn anything that can help me creating films and animations, because I'm aiming to become a big director and filmmaker. 
  I'm fueled by passion for learning everything I can in field of filmmaking and I'm very ambitious in my path of life and wants to be successful in everything and be the best. I hunger for knowledge and determination to turn passion into work.
  Meanwhile, I vastly improved in working with computers and digital media. I believe mindfulness in the workplace is key to success.
