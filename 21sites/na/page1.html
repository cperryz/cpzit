<p style="color:DodgerBlue;"> .Type:Theatre Devas Street, Manchester, M15 6JA
Manchesters performing arts venue on Manchesterâ€™s Oxford Road.
 Great fun - most impressive reflection of the community Contact is where young people change their lives through the arts, and audiences of all ages experience exciting new shows.

We are the leading national theatre and arts venue to place young people at the decision-making heart of everything.

At Contact, young people aged 13-30 genuinely lead, working alongside staff in deciding the artistic programme, making staff appointments and act as full Board members.
The result is an outstanding, diverse and accessible artistic programme for everyone.</p>
