<p>Giant inflatable monsters will be taking over the rooftops of Manchester again as Halloween in the City returns.

Launched as a single set of tentacles snaking from the roof of House of Fraser in 2017, the creepy characters have multiplied over the years to form a trail between some of the city's best-known landmarks.

Visitors can spot them at the Arndale, Spinningfields, The Printworks, Selfridges, the Great Northern Warehouse, Moda Angel Gardens and 111 Piccadilly from October 26 to November 1.</p>
