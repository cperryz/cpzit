<p>	In different times we need different ways to get together. The National Football Museum is delighted to announce that we can now host virtual/hybrid events.

Working with a fantastic production partner we’ll ensure your event runs smoothly and without a hitch. Whether it’s a Zoom meeting for ten or a multi-platform function for a larger audience we can help.  We’ve lots of packages available so drop us a line or give us a call.

If you want a more traditional event we can still help, either in our purpose built meeting spaces or the main galleries.  We’ve got all the health and safety measures in place that you’d expect so you can be reassured that you and your clients can confidently enjoy your event.</p>
