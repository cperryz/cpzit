	<h2>What is the dark web? How to access it and what you'll find</h2>
	</div>
	<div class="dark_text1">
	<p> The dark web is part of the internet that isn't visible 
	to search engines and requires the use of an anonymizing 
	browser called Tor to be accessed.<br><br> The dark web is a 
	part of the internet that isn't indexed by search engines. 
	You've no doubt heard talk of the “dark web” as a hotbed of 
	criminal activity — and it is. A 2019 study, Into the Web 
	of Profit, conducted by Dr. Michael McGuires at the 
	University of Surrey, shows that things have become worse.
	The number of dark web listings that could harm an enterprise
	has risen by 20% since 2016. Of all listings (excluding those 
	selling drugs), 60% could potentially harm enterprises. <br><br>
	You can buy credit card numbers, all manner of drugs, guns, 
	counterfeit money, stolen subscription credentials, hacked Netflix
	accounts and software that helps you break into other people’s 
	computers. Buy login credentials to a $50,000 Bank of America 
	account for $500. Get $3,000 in counterfeit $20 bills for $600. 
	#Buy seven prepaid debit cards, each with a $2,500 balance, for 
	$500 (express shipping included). A “lifetime” Netflix premium 
	account goes for $6. You can hire hackers to attack computers for you.
	You can buy usernames and passwords. <br><br>All this activity, this 
	vision of a bustling marketplace, might make you think that navigating
	the dark web is easy. It isn’t. The place is as messy and chaotic as 
	you would expect when everyone is anonymous, and a substantial 
	minority are out to scam others. Accessing the dark web requires 
	the use of an anonymizing browser called Tor. The Tor browser routes 
	your web page requests through a series of proxy servers operated by
	thousands of volunteers around the globe, rendering your IP address 
	unidentifiable and untraceable. Tor works like magic, but the result
	is an experience that’s like the dark web itself: unpredictable, 
	unreliable and maddeningly slow.</p>

	<h2> Whats the difference between the dark and deep web?</h2>
	</div>
	<div class="dark_text4">
	<p> Many times the two terms 
	are used interchangeably as if 
	they are more or less the same 
	thing. This is very inaccurate,
	as the deep web just refers to 
	non-indexed pages, while the dark
	web refers to pages which are both
	non-indexed and involved in illegal niches.
	This image using an iceberg metaphor should 
	clear it up in an easier to comprehend way. 
	As you can notice, ironically, the dark web
	is actually deeper than the deep web. <br><br>
	The bottom line is this: the deep web might be 
	made of up of non-indexed pages simply because 
	search engines fail to see them or because they’re 
	not deemed relevant enough to be indexed. In contrast,
	the dark web wants to be hidden, since it’s a hub 
	for shady business on purpose. The deep web is ethically
	neutral, it can be used for good or for bad. The dark
	web is where the parts of moral-lacking economy and 
	society come together. As far as the relationship 
	between them goes, not all deep web is dark web, 
	but all dark web is deep web.</p>
