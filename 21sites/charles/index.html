	Sometimes people will try to trick you into clicking dangerous links or sharing things about yourself. 
	Or something you’ve shared might be used to bully or frighten you.There are lots of fun and interesting

	<p> Our I.T experts are trained staff and volunteers. All sorts of people become Cyber Security Analysts.
	They’re all different ages and come from lots of different backgrounds. But what they all have in common
	is that they want to help people of all ages. A cyber security analyst is primarily responsible for protecting
	a company's network and systems from cyber attacks. Thats why I created this website, it is to spread awareness 
	of the threats we face everyday as users of the internet. Here is a list of the most common cyber threats:
	<ul>
     <li>Malware</li>
     <li>Phishing</li>
     <li>Man in the Middle</li>
	 <li>XSS scripting</li>
     <li>DDoS</li>
     </ul>
	Although this website is open to all ages, it was designed specifically for adolescents as those of younger
	age are guranteed to use technology in their future. You are vulnerable to cyber attacks if you go shopping online,
	stream movies/TV shows, or even using something as small as a smart heating system.
