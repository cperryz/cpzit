	<h2> What is streaming and is it safe?</h2>
	</div>
	<div class="streaming_text1">
	<p>  Streaming refers to any media content 
	– live or recorded – delivered to computers 
	and mobile devices via the internet and played
	back in real time. Podcasts, webcasts, movies, 
	TV shows and music videos are common forms of 
	streaming content. Music, video and other types 
	of media files are prearranged and transmitted 
	in sequential packets of data so they can be 
	streamed instantaneously. And unlike traditional 
	downloads that are stored on your device, media 
	files are automatically deleted once you play them. 
	All you need to stream is a reliable and fast high
	speed internet connection, access or subscription 
	to a streaming service or app, and a compatible 
	device. See speed recommendations below. <br><br> 
	Live streaming is the broadcast of an event over the
	internet as it happens. Awards shows, sports, boxing
	matches, video games and special one-time events 
	are the most popular types of live streaming with 
	an ever-growing menu of topics. Social media platforms
	and others broadcast everything from celebrity events,
	promotions and lifestreaming to streaming between users.
	You can live stream on any compatible smartphone, tablet,
	TV, computer or gaming console with a relatively fast 
	internet connection.</p>

	<h2>When does streaming become illegal? </h2>
	</div>
	<div class="streaming_text2">
	<p> Illegal streaming is the streaming of 
	pirated copies of films or TV shows or 
	premium sports content without the copyright 
	owner’s permission. This can include watching 
	illegal content using an add-on accessed
	from a device like a set-top box or a stick,
	streaming from an unauthorised website, or 
	streaming via an app (on a mobile phone, tablet, 
	laptop or gaming system.)<br><br>
	
	Streaming hardware devices like set-top-boxes,
	or sticks in their unaltered form are legal - 
	but many are being modified and then sold, with 
	unauthorised add-ons pre-installed that allow 
	people to access, stream and watch pirated copies
	of copyrighted content illegally. Some examples 
	of pirated content are films that are not yet 
	released in the UK, TV programmes that haven’t aired 
	yet or that are only being shown in the UK on 
	subscription channels for which you don’t have an
	account, pay-per-view offerings for which you have
	not paid and sports events that are shown legally only
	on sports channels for which you do not have a subscription.</p>
