<h1> Gaming Safety</h1>

<div class="gaming_text1"> 
<p> Did you know... <br>
Half of parents (51%) worry<br>
about their child’s safety Nearly two in ten (16%) say their kids <br> 
have been bullied or abused online. <br></p>

	<h2> How safe is online gaming? </h2>
	</div>
	<div class="gaming_text2">
	<p> The risks arise largely from the vast number of people both in the 
	UK and abroad who are also playing, the minimal restrictions involved 
	and the fact that they are not face-to-face. Because of this, your 
	child cannot be sure who they are playing against and chatting to … 
	or what their motives are. Sadly, being taken advantage of by strangers with
	sexual, abusive, fraudulent or other criminal motives is becoming more commonplace.
	The risks are increased as more and more games are being played on mobile devices
	rather than the 'family computer', giving you less opportunity to check up 
	on what your children are doing online. Talking to someone about what’s happening 
	can help you to think about your gaming differently. They can help support if you’re
	struggling to stop or talk to you about ways you could feel better. Telling someone about
	what’s happening can be difficult. If you’re struggling, you could try writing a 
	letter or talking to a Childline counsellor first. Remember, if your gaming is affecting 
	your health if you’re worried you can always speak to your doctor.<br><br>
	Based on industry reports and current trends, the prevalence of DDoS attacks is increasing
	at a rapid pace. According to one recent study, the number of reported incidents across all
	industries doubled in 2014. The increasing frequency and size of DDoS events are well
	reflected in the gaming industry. Assaults against such companies are invariably aimed at 
	the network layer (since most gaming servers do not support HTTP); they bombard a server 
	with requests until it slows down to an intolerable level or connections collapse altogether. 
	In fact, according to another recent report, gaming servers are still the number one target
	of DDoS assaults; they have been hit by some of the largest and longest attacks 
	on recent record.

	<h2> Keep your childs online gaming safe</h2>

	<p>
	<ul>
	<li>Have open and honest conversations with your children about their online gaming and the risks involved. </li> 
	<li>Educate your children about the dangers of revealing private information such as their email address, home address, family members or financial details.</li> 
	<li>Explain that not everybody is who they seem or claim to be, and their motives may be dishonourable.</li> 
	<li>Tell your children not to respond to bullying or other abuse, and to report it to you straight away.</li> 
	<li>Join your children in online gaming from time to time and randomly. This will give you an idea of the games they’re playing and who they connect with.</li> 
	<li>Set and monitor limits for the amount of daily or weekly time your children spend online gaming.</li> 
	<li>Check age ratings of games to ensure your children aren’t accessing inappropriate content. It’s 18 for a reason!</li> 
	<li>Never give your child your payment card details as extras can be very costly. </li> 
	</ul>
		If someone’s harassing or bullying you online, you can report it on the site or app.
		Even if someone else has reported it, making a report yourself can make it more likely
		the content will be removed. Don't reply to abusive messages or posts as this can make 
		things worse. It’s natural to want to see what people are saying when they’re bullying you.
		But taking time away from your phone or device, even for a few minutes, can help you to feel 
		calmer.If you’re being bullied by people at school, your school has a responsibility to support
		you. If you have screenshots or evidence of what's been happening, show them to a teacher you trust.<br><br>

	<h2> How does a DDoS work and how does it affect me? </h2>
	</div>
	<div class="gaming_text4">
	<p> In computing, a denial-of-service attack 
	(DoS attack) is a cyber-attack in which the 
	perpetrator seeks to make a machine or network 
	resource unavailable to its intended users by 
	temporarily or indefinitely disrupting services
	of a host connected to the Internet. This works
	by flooding the target with requests, so many that 
	the device struggles to process all requests and either
	slows down dramatically or shuts down completely.</p>
