	<h2> How to identify a safe website for online shopping?</h2>
	</div>
	<div class="shopping_text1">
	<p> When visiting a website that asks for sensitive information 
	such as credit card numbers or your social security number, 
	the first step you can take to securing your privacy is creating
	a strong password. Equally important is verifying that any information
	you enter on this site is transmitted and stored properly. Once your 
	information is entered online, it is transmitted as plain text for anyone
	to intercept. To avoid this, make sure that the website is encrypted over a 
	secure connection.<br><br>
	HTTPS<br>
	One such sign to look for is in the URL of the website. A secure website’s URL
	should begin with “https” rather than “http”. The “s” at the end of “http” 
	stands for secure and is using an SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) connection. Your
	information will be encrypted before being sent to a server.<br><br>
	THE LOCK ICON <br>
	Another sign to look for is the “Lock” icon that is displayed somewhere in the
	window of your web browser. Different browsers may position the lock in different 
	places</p>

	<h2> What is an SSL/TLS certificate?</h2>
	</div>
	<div class="shopping_text2">
	<p> There’s a lot of information in a certificate, including basic things like: <br><br>
<ul>
<li>Validity Period.</li>
<li>Issuing Certificate Authority (CA).</li>
<li>Subject (the domain it was issued to and depending on the type of certificate, identifying information about the company operating the site).</li>
</ul>
Certificate contents also cover technical aspects, such as:
<ul>
<li>Key Usage.</li>
<li>CRL Information.</li>
<li>Signing and Hashing Algorithms Underlying the Encryption.</li> 
</ul><br>
	
	An SSL certificate is installed on the server side but there 
	are visual cues on the browser which can tell users that 
	they are protected by SSL. Firstly, if SSL is present on the
	site, users will see https:// at the start of the web address
	rather than the http:// (the extra "s" stand for "secure").
	Depending on what level of validation a certificate is given 
	to the business, a secure connection may be indicated by the 
	presence of a padlock icon or a green address bar signal. Google
	now advocates that HTTPS, or SSL, should be used everywhere on 
	the web and, as of 2014, the search engine has been rewarding 
	secured websites with improved web rankings, another great reason
	for any site to install SSL. Transport Layer Security (TLS) is the
	successor protocol to SSL. TLS is an improved version of SSL. It
	works in much the same way as the SSL, using encryption to protect 
	the transfer of data and information. The two terms are often used 
	interchangeably in the industry although SSL is still widely used.
	When you buy an 'SSL' certificate from DigiCert, you can of course
	use it with both SSL and TLS protocols.</p>
