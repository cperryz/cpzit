	<div class="social_text1">
	<p> When visiting a website that asks for sensitive information 
	such as credit card numbers or your social security number, 
	the first step you can take to securing your privacy is creating
	a strong password. Equally important is verifying that any information
	you enter on this site is transmitted and stored properly. Once your 
	information is entered online, it is transmitted as plain text for anyone
	to intercept. To avoid this, make sure that the website is encrypted over a 
	secure connection.<br><br>
	HTTPS<br>
	One such sign to look for is in the URL of the website. A secure website’s URL
	should begin with “https” rather than “http”. The “s” at the end of “http” 
	stands for secure and is using an SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) connection. Your
	information will be encrypted before being sent to a server.<br><br>
	THE LOCK ICON <br>
	Another sign to look for is the “Lock” icon that is displayed somewhere in the
	window of your web browser. Different browsers may position the lock in different 
	places</p>

	<h2> What can I do to stay safe online?</h2>
	</div>
	<div class="social_text2">
	<p> There are lots of things you can do to keep yourself safe online.
	<ul>
	<li><h4> Think before you post </h4>
	Don’t upload or share anything you wouldn’t want your parents,
	carers, teachers or future employers seeing. Once you post something,
	you lose control of it, especially if someone else screenshots or shares it. </li>
	<li><h4>Don’t share personal details</h4>
	Keep things like your address, phone number, full name, school and date 
	of birth private, and check what people can see in your privacy settings. 
	Remember that people can use small clues like a school logo in a photo to 
	find out a lot about you. </li>
	<li><h4>Watch out for phishing and scams</h4>
	Phishing is when someone tries to trick you into giving them information,
	like your password. Someone might also try to trick you by saying they 
	can make you famous or that they’re from a talent agency. Never click 
	links from emails or messages that ask you to log in or share your details,
	even if you think they might be genuine. If you’re asked to log into a 
	website, go to the app or site directly instead.</li>
	<li><h4>Think about who you’re talking to </h4>
	There are lots of ways that people try to trick you into trusting them online.
	Even if you like and trust someone you’ve met online, never share personal 
	information with them like your address, full name, or where you go to school.
	Find out more about grooming.</li>
	<li><h4>Keep your device secure</h4>
	Make sure that you’re keeping your information and device secure.</li>
	<li><h4>Never give out your password</h4>
	You should never give out your password or log-in information. Make sure you pick strong, easy to remember passwords.</li></p>
