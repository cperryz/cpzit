    OUR OLD TRAFFORD STADIUM, COMMONLY KNOWN AS "THE THEATRE OF DREAMS," WAS ORIGINALLY OPENED ON FEBRUARY 19, 1910 WITH A CAPACITY OF APPROXIMATELY 80,000. DURING THE SECOND WORLD WAR, OLD TRAFFORD WAS USED BY THE MILITARY AS A DEPOT, AND ON MARCH 11, 1941 WAS HEAVILY DAMAGED BY A GERMAN BOMBING RAID. THE STADIUM WAS REBUILT FOLLOWING THE WAR AND REOPENED ON AUGUST 24, 1949. THE ADDITION OF FLOODLIGHTING, PERMITTING EVENING MATCHES, WAS COMPLETED IN 1957 AND A PROJECT TO COVER THE STANDS WITH ROOFS WAS COMPLETED IN 1959. AFTER A SERIES OF ADDITIONS DURING THE 1960S, 1970S AND EARLY 1980S, CAPACITY AT OLD TRAFFORD REACHED 56,385 IN 1985. THE CONVERSION OF THE STADIUM TO AN ALL-SEATER REDUCED CAPACITY TO APPROXIMATELY 44,000 BY 1992, THE LOWEST IN ITS HISTORY. THEREAFTER, WE BEGAN TO EXPAND CAPACITY THROUGHOUT THE STADIUM, BRINGING CAPACITY TO APPROXIMATELY 58,000 BY 1996, APPROXIMATELY 68,000 BY 2000, AND APPROXIMATELY 76,000 IN 2006. CURRENT CAPACITY AT OLD TRAFFORD IS 75,454. </p>
