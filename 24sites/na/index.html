<h1>Manchester Tourism</h1>
<p>Why we love Manchester. Home to world-famous football, renowned art galleries and a music scene that brought Oasis to Centre stage – there's lots to love about Manchester. Once the world's manufacturing powerhouse, its former industrial buildings now bounce with energy. Manchester was right at the heart of the Revolution, becoming the UK's leading producer of cotton and textiles. Manchester is also famous for being the first industrialized city in the world. Manchester was responsible for the country's first ever working canal in 1761 and the world's first ever railway line in 1830.Manchester is renowned for its entertainment, with a plethora of cinemas, theatre and legendary clubs for great night-time amusement. There are many opportunities to go sightseeing in Greater Manchester, with a number of walking tours, bus and taxi tours such as the Sightseeing Manchester Bus Tour.​
