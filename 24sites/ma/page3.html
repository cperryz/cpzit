<p> Join us on Thursday evenings as we switch our lights on, and head out on the water for a tour of Salford Quays by night.  Put on your neon, bring your glow sticks and head torches as we paddle under the city lights.  It really is quite a spectacular place to paddle at night!​

    On each session there’s two options to choose from when booking, you can book on to either the Katakanu/Rafted Canoe session or the Stand Up Paddlboard or Kayak Session, both sessions will start at the same time and we’ll all be in one big group on the water.​
    
    Our Katakanu’s and Rafted canoes offer a more stable paddle where participants shouldn’t expect to fall in or get wet (unless it’s raining of course!)​
    
    Our Katas and Rafted Canoes seat up to 6 people in each boat, they are suitable for all abilities and are perfect for adults and youths over 8yrs. Each boat will require at least 2 adults and anyone under the age of 17 must be accompanied by a paying adult on the water. As there are 6 spaces on each boat, you may need to share a boat with other people, you can book the whole boat out by booking 6 spaces but please note, you will need at least 2-3 adults to paddle the boat efficiently.  The minimum age is strictly 8 years old and anyone aged 8-16 must be accompanied on the same boat by a paying adult.​ </p>
