<p> A quarter of a century later the markets continue to attract Mancunians and visitors alike to the city in their thousands to fill up on the fantastic festive treats on offer.
     With over 225 stalls across nine sites throughout the city centre this year's Christmas markets will see the iconic ski chalet market stalls take over Piccadilly Gardens - once again set to be transformed into the Winter Gardens - as well as Market Street, Cathedral Gardens, Exchange Street, New Cathedral Street, St Ann's Square, Exchange Square, The Corn Exchange and King Street. </p>
