<h1> Bolton </h1>
<p>Bolton is a town in Greater Manchester in England. In the foothills of the West Pennine Moors, Bolton is between Manchester (10 miles (16 km) south-east), Blackburn, Wigan, Bury and Salford.
<br> It is surrounded by several towns and villages that form the wider borough, of which Bolton is the administrative centre. The town is also within the historic county boundaries of Lancashire.
<br>A former mill town, Bolton has been a centre for textile production since the 14th century when Flemish weavers settled in the area, introducing a wool and cotton-weaving tradition. 
<br>It was a 19th-century boomtown, development largely coincided with the introduction of textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution. At its peak in 1929, its 216 cotton mills and 26 bleaching and dyeing works made it one of the largest and most productive centres of cotton spinning in the world.
<br> The British cotton industry declined sharply after the First World War and, by the 1980s, cotton manufacture had virtually ceased in the town.</p>
