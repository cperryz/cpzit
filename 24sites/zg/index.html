<h1>Welcome to Manchester</h1>
<p> Adopted by Manchester in the 19th Century, the Manchester Bee symbolizes the industrious nature of the city and its people. The bee can be found on many of Manchesters street furniture and can be seen within the mosaic floor in Manchesters Town Hall.
<br>
<br>It was in 1904 that Charles Rolls and Henry Royce first met in Manchesters city center Midland Hotel. Two years later the company Rolls-Royce Ltd was formed. Visit the Midland Hotel for afternoon tea and see the statue dedicated to their meeting.
<br>In 1948 Manchester University professors developed the first computer to have a stored programme and memory. Nicknamed 'Baby' it has made the computer what it is today. A replica can be seen at the Science and Industry Museum.
