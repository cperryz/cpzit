<h1>manchester art gallery</h1>
<p>Starting in 2023, Manchester Art Gallery is Taking Stock of the collection.
     This is a unique opportunity to explore the rich potential of the Cityâ€™s
      collection and how it is used.A programme of building repairs at Manchester Art Gallery,
       Platt Hall and our conservation studios in Queens Park will lead to better storage and physical
        access to our collections, as well as safeguarding their future. This work will transform how our
         collection is experienced by visitors and used by staff, volunteers, artists and communities. </p>
