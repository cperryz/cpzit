<h1 style="color:purple"> Zombie Walk Festival </h1>
<p style="color:purple">
The Zombie Walk Festival is a charity based event held across the world where people gather in a public area, get into zombie costumes, and publicly do a zombie walk. </p>
<p style="color:purple">
The event is on the 30th of October at 6pm, this is because October is the time of Halloween. </p>
<p style="color:purple">
The event itself is rather simple, expect a lot of people dressed up as zombies doing a zombie walk. </p>

Strangely enough, this event was intially an accident that happened at the 2000 GenCon to poke fun at Vampire LARPers, a stunt done in good nature for fun. When zombie movies became popular, so did this event. </p>
