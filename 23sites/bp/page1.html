<h1 style="color:purple"> King Street Festival</h1>
<p style="color:purple">
The King Street Festival is a festival dedicated to King Street, a popular and iconic shopping and dining location in Manchester </p>
<p style="color:purple">
The event typically takes place over the first weekend of June, this is linked to the Central Manchester bombing of 1996 that took place on the third weekend of June that year. This incident seemed to make the sections damaged by the bomb more poular, including King Street. </p>

Unlike a majority of events, the King Street Festival is free to enter, which makes what it has to offer more interesting. The event has many discounted pop up bars available, including it's own Cocktail Trail, which shows the streets best bars cocktails priced at Â£5. It also features lots of music and it's own Flower Show. </p>
