<p>Welcome to my website which will tell you what some of the best things to do in Manchester are and also give you some information about what they are and what you can do and there will also be a button to book your tickets, there will also be a map to show you the locations of everything to do, Manchester is a big place with a lot of shops and a lot of history and a big library, and a lot of restaurant options and a huge shopping mall that has a food court in it and some events go on there one I have experience with is the duck race which happens in the canals of Manchester and in Piccadilly around Christmas time there is a something called the Christmas market which is a collection of a lot of things like an ice ring and food and gift shops. </p>
