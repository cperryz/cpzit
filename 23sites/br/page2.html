<h1>Science and Industry Museum</h1>
<p> Come and visit the science and industry museum where you can learn the history of science and industry with a bunch of things inside it all to do with the history of science and industry, but there is also a gift shop where you can buy a bunch of stuff like souvenirs and trinkets but you can also buy some cool things like kits for science and space kits for stuff like the mars rover but there are other museums around the country like the railway museum and the science and media museum(but that is in Bradford not Manchester) and Iâ€™m sure there gift shops in there to and on the media museum they can show movies because they have IMAX screens. </p>
